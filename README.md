# SpikeLab
A set of tools for neural-simulation, debugging, and visualization.

## What SpikeLab isn't
SpikeLab is not an accurate neural-simulator, the reason for this comes from the complexity of a biological neuron, there are too many mechanisms that give rise to the behavior of a neuron, simulating all of those mechanisms for a large scale network of neurons would be too resource intensive, therefore SpikeLab simulates the excitation/inhibition and temporal summation mechanisms that give rise to an action potential with minimal branching so we could simulate hundreds or thousands of neurons on retail hardware without issues.

## I Want To Learn To Make My Own Simulation
So you want to create your own simulator? That's great! Scroll down to the "References" tab for the resources I used to create this project.

[The fundamentals of Neuroscience](https://www.edx.org/xseries/harvardx-fundamentals-of-neuroscience) on edX is a great first start, Dr. David Cox created a series of three awesome courses that are free and I recommend it to everyone interested in the subject. I also recommend getting certified on edX as you can get a cool [certificate](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/13361343b546445db3221f6a25862912) to show off your effort :)
